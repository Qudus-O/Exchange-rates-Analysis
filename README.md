# *Data Visualization of Exchange Rates*

To begin our analysis, we utilized the built-in Python library, Pandas, to load the exchange rate data effectively. Following this, we conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, identify patterns, and uncover any anomalies. This process involved examining various features of the data, including missing values, distribution of values, and correlations among different currency rates.

Once we gained insights from the EDA, our focus shifted to visualizing the performance of the US dollar (USD) in comparison to other currencies. We employed Matplotlib, a powerful plotting library in Python, to create informative and visually appealing graphs. These visualizations aimed to depict trends over time, allowing us to observe fluctuations in the value of the US dollar and draw meaningful conclusions about its performance in the global market.
